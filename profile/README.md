## Tidal Development
Tidal Development is a small, independent team made up of two developers who enjoy building cool stuff.
Our main goal is to provide cool content for other people to enjoy. This includes potentially game engines, apps, game mods, app alternatives (think discord, spotify, photoshop, and more), etc.

## The Team
We are a small team of two developers currently, and we do not intend to add more at the moment.
